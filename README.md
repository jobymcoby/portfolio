# Portfolio
A collection of school work and personal projects
This repository contains a collection of school work and personal projects I developed. The projects showcase different skills and interests of mine in various fields, including machine learning, game development, and software engineering.

## Projects
The repository includes four projects:
 1. GAN: This project involves the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using Python. The aim of the project is to generate realistic images of video game sprites using a free dataset.
 2. Image Classifier: This project involves the implementation of an image classifier using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning. The aim of the project is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into ten categories.
 4. Tactics and Procedural Map Generation: This project involves creating tactics and maps in the S3 game. 
 5. Video Game in Unity and C#: This project involves the development of a video game using the Unity game engine and C# programming language. The game is still in progress.
